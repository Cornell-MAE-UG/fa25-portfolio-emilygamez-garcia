The final project for MAE 3230 - Introductory Fluid Mechanics was to disassemble a fluid mechanical device and analyze a component to figure out how it works. My group took apart a push lawnmower and in dissecting the engine, chose to focus on the carburator. Our analysis and understanding of the carburator was compiled into a video. 

My main contribution to the project was the physical engine dissection and getting measurements so I could complete our pressure calculation.
